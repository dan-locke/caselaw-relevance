						<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Assessing documents</h6>
						<hr>
						Topics consist of an area of law from a decision of the United States Supreme Court. Each topic is the question asked in an appeal to the United States Supreme Court.  
						<br/><br/>
						Several queries will be issued on loading the page. This may take some time (up to around a minute). A list of these queries are available in the search tab.
						<br/><br/>
						From there, further searches are required as you see fit. Please aim for a minimum of X documents per topic. 
						<br/><br/>
						When assessing documents, there are the following relevance levels:
						<ul> 
							<li>not relevant;</li>
							<li>background;</li>
							<li>explanatory; and</li>
							<li>on point.</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- <br/><br/> -->
						<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Tagging</h6>
						<hr>
						Please tag documents where the text is relevant to the topic, as per the relevance level you select for the document. 
						<br/><br/>
						You can tag by selecting the text in the judgment and pressing the tag button in the tags tab, or by pressing the key 't'.
						<br/><br/>
						<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Search</h6>
						<hr>
						Search operators follow the LexisNexis style and precedence. 

						The following operators are suported, in the following precedence: 
						<ul> 
							<li>OR</li>
							<li>w/n</li>
							<li>w/s</li>
							<li>w/p</li>
							<li>AND</li>
							<li>NOT</li>
						</ul>
						You can use w/s and w/p in combinination with w/n operators. This is because, w/s and w/p default to a proximity of 20 and 50 terms respectively.
						<br/><br/>
						Terms will not match their derivations. ie. car. will not match care or cared. To do this, you must use the prefix operators ('!'). 
						<br/><br/>
						Wildcard operators are supported in clauses that do not involve proximity operators. Both "*" and "!" are supported as wildcard operators. Two instances are applicable:
						<ul>

							<li>"car*" or "car!" - in which case, the term, "car", denotes a prefix, and any terms that have the term as its prefix are matched - ie. car, carried, carrier;</li>
							<li>"car*d" - in which case, the asterisk denotes any number of characters that may be matched before the prefix and suffix are to be matched.</li>
						</ul>
						A maximum of 20 new results are returned for a search, in which duplicates of already returned documents are excluded.
						<br/><br/>
