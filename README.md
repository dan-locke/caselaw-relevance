- for delete tag, correct deletion rather than hide current
- for highlight, need to retain whole text of first childNode so that search works (however need to factor in index)
- really, this just requires fixing the input of a span surrounding the text in the node...
- for find in page, search only on content
- for topics, allocate topics to assessor based on number of topics and assessors
- fix exclusion of duplicates in search results
